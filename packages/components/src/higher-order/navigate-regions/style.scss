	// Fixes for edge cases.
	// Some of the regions are currently used for layout purposes as 'interface skeleton'
	// items. When they're absolutely positioned or when they contain absolutely
	// positioned elements, they may have no size therefore the focus style is not
	// visible. For the future, it's important to take into consideration that
	// the navigable regions should always have a computed size. For now, we can
	// fix some edge cases but these CSS rules should be later removed in favor of
	// a more abstracted approach to make the navigabel regions focus style work
	// regardles of the CSS used on other components.
